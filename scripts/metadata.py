longDescription: 
    This dataset comprises national time series for representing building heat pumps in power system models. 
    The heat demand of buildings and the coefficient of performance (COP) of heat pumps is calculated 
    for 16 European countries from {start} to {end} in an hourly resolution.  
    
    Heat demand time series for space and water heating are computed by combining gas standard 
    load profiles with spatial temperature and wind speed reanalysis data as well as population geodata.  
    The profiles are year-wise scaled to 1 TWh each. For the years 2008 to 2012, the data is additionally 
    scaled with annual statistics on the final energy consumption for heating.
    
    COP time series for different heat sources – air, ground, and groundwater – and different heat sinks 
    – floor heating, radiators, and water heating – are calculated based on COP and heating curves 
    using reanalysis temperature data, spatially aggregated with respect to the heat demand, 
    and corrected based on field measurements.
    
    All data processing as well as the download of relevant input data is conducted in python 
    and pandas and has been documented in the Jupyter notebooks linked below.
